<h1 align="center">Thrive Juices and Smoothies Website</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://elainebroche-dev.github.io/ms1-thrive/)

THRIVE Juices and Smoothies is a site that advertises a fictional refreshment business.  The business primarily sells juices and smoothies and also a limited range of healthy snacks and hot beverages.  The site is targeted toward people who want to buy healthy refreshments "on the go" - the business also has a seating area for anyone who wants to stay and socialise but it's primary USP is the appeal, taste and quality of the products.  The site will be useful for people who want to check out the range of products available, location of the business and it's opening hours.

## Design

-    ### Imagery
        -   The hero and large background images have been chosen because they are eye-catching, fresh and bright.  The citrus and light pastel colours in the images were chosen to help convey a sense of energy, health and freshness.  The images depict fruit to align with the main business goal of selling juices and smoothies and were chosen for their "simplicity" (- e.g. a single type of fruit or repeating theme) to help keep the site clear and easy to use.

-    ### Colour Scheme
        -  A citrus/pastel palette was used to convey a fresh, energetic mood
        ![Colour Palette](https://elainebroche-dev.github.io/ms1-thrive/documentation/supp-images/citruspalette.png)

-    ### Typography
        -   Google Fonts were used to import Lato and Oswald fonts into styles.css.  These were chosen as they work well together and have a simple, unembellished, modern feel that is easy to read.
