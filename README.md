-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The colours used were based on a citrus/pastel palette from this website :https://www.lilybugdesign.co.nz/colour-wall  ![Colour Palette](assets/images/citruspalette.png)

    -   #### Typography
        -   ebr : to be written
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The hero and large background images have been chosen because they are eye-catching, fresh and bright.  The citrus and light pastel colours in the images were chosen to help convey a sense of energy, health and freshness.  The images depict fruit to align with the main business goal of selling juices and smoothies and were chosen for their "simplicity" (- e.g. a single type of fruit or repeating theme) to help make the site clear and easy to use.
